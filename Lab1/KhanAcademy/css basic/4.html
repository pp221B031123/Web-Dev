        <h1>Travel to Hawaii</h1>
        <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/beach-in-hawaii.png" width="400">
        <h2 id="basicinfo">Basic Info</h2>
        <p>Hawaii is a state in the <em class="info">Western United States</em>, located in the Pacific Ocean about <strong class="info">2,000 miles (3,200 km)</strong> from the U.S. mainland.<br> It is the only U.S. state outside North America, the only state that is <strong class="info">an archipelago</strong>, and the only state in the tropics.</p>
        <h2 id="top5">Top 5 beautiful places in Hawaii</h2>
        <ol>
           <strong> <li>Hanauma Bay</li></strong>
           <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/beach-at-dusk.png" width="200">
            <p id="hanama">This bay is so beautiful and has such a rich marine ecosystem that Hawaiian royalty used to come here to fish and hang out. These days you don't have to be regal to swim with the tropical fish and enjoy the views from the beach. The park was declared a protected marine life conservation area in 1967 and remains one of the most beautiful snorkeling spots in the state.</p>
            <strong><li>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park</li></strong>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/beach-sunset.png" width="200">
            <p id="volcano">The island of Hawaii, aka the Big Island, may be the largest island in the Hawaiian chain, but it’s also the youngest. The island was made from the composites of multiple volcanic eruptions, and it's not done growing; there are still four active volcanoes on the island today. You can see two of these at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, including Mauna Loa, the largest active volcano on Earth.</p>
            <strong><li>The Hana Highway</li></strong>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/beach-waves-at-sunset.png" width="200">
            <p id="hana">The road to Hana may be the Maui go-to, but there’s a reason for that. This 52-mile stretch of coastal road connects Kahului to the quiet town of Hana. It’s special because along the drive — which can take anywhere from two to four hours — you’ll pass waterfalls, swimming holes, lush rainforests, hiking trails, and plenty of incredible beaches. It’s practically impossible to stay in the car.</p>
            <strong><li>Keahiakawelo (Garden of the Gods)</li></strong>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/beach.png" width="200">
            <p id="god">Most people picture lush green valleys and sprawling beaches when they think of Hawaii, but you’ll feel like you’re on Mars in Keahiakawelo, an otherworldly landscape of rock towers and boulders found on the northwest side of Lanai. The area is particularly enchanting at dusk, when the setting sun brings out the rocks' brilliant reds and oranges.</p>
            <strong><li>Halawa Valley</li></strong>
            <img src="https://cdn.kastatic.org/third_party/javascript-khansrc/live-editor/build/images/landscapes/fields-of-wine.png" width="200">
            <p id="halawa">There’s something a little extra magical about the island of Molokai, which is home to a high percentage of native Hawaiians, the highest sea cliffs in the world, and the state's longest continuous fringing reef (a reef found close to shore). It’s also where you’ll find Halawa Valley, a sacred place in Hawaiian history. What was once a place of worship and home to ancient Polynesians is now a destination of jaw-dropping beauty — from cascading waterfalls to rainforest-traversing trails and sprawling views.</p>
